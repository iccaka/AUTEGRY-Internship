# AUTEGRY Internship

*The project that I managed to complete during my time at AUTEGRY.*

## Built With

* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - *The IDE used*

## Notes

This is not the original repository that I worked on, hence there aren't any commits, branches, pull requests, etc.
I moved everything here except for a bunch of things that had to remain private. Most notably those are the 
Performance.json and RRFM.csv files containing most of the input data for the program modules. The values inside 
config.json and test data inside test_cpf.py and test_output.py have also been removed, for the same reasons. It goes 
without saying the project won't run without fully intact if it's not 100% there. But I still decided to upload it. It 
shows that I have actually done something during my time at AUTEGRY.
